//! # uploader: Universal interface for external source/item upload
//!
//! This module defines a single trait (`Uploader`) and concrete supporting types
//! for uploading external sources (e.g. repositories, document spaces)
//! and their items (files, documents) into a project knowledge bucket via
//! an external API, local system, or a mock/test implementation.
//!
//! ## Interface & Extensibility
//! - Implement the [`Uploader`] trait to create new upload clients (e.g. API, file-based).
//! - All methods are async, returning results and using boxed error types.
//! - Error handling is uniform: all API/caller errors return boxed trait objects.
//! - Meant for both production code and robust mocking in tests.
//!
//! ## Mocking & Testing
//! - The trait is annotated for `mockall` so consumers can generate deterministic mocks for unit/integration tests.
//!
//! ## Type Sources
//! - Request and response types (e.g., `NewExternalSource`, `ExternalSource`, `NewExternalItem`, `ExternalItem`) are plain data; see docs for field descriptions.
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//! - See the core binary crate or test suite for concrete implementorsâ€”API client, test-mock, etc.
//!
//! ## Adding New Upload Destinations
//! - Implement the trait for your destination.
//! - Ensure methods are infallible in their contract: convert all meaningful upstream errors to a boxed error.
//! - Return concrete, understandable error variants on user/config/connection issues.
